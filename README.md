Hello! If you ever wondering why I can keep up the contribution streak then it's because of my daily pushing discipline. But when I slip on a random day and can't contribute, that's when this thing kicks in and saves the game by pushing a dummy file at 10:30pm my local time if i haven't contributed on that day.
